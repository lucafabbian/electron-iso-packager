# Script to download an extension and its dependencies written by Richard A. Rost July 7,2019
# The script downloads to the directory you are in when you start the script.
# There are no Tinycore specific commands, variables, or directories required so it should work
# on any Linux box.
# Some error checking is done, though it might not be as thorough as it should be.
# The script downloads the  .tcz,  .tcz.dep,  and  .tcz.md5.txt  files for each extension.
# MD5 is verified.
# File ownership is changed to tc:staff.
# A running timestamped log is kept in  ./Log.txt
# ./Extension.list  is a sorted  .tree  file with duplicates removed of the last extension downloaded.
#
# Usage:
#
#	FetchExt.sh ExtensionName	Fetches the extension and its dependencies. ExtensionName is
#					case sensitive and should NOT include the  .tcz  extension.
#
#	FetchExt.sh info		Fetches the list of available extensions in the listed repository.
#
